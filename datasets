Regarding datasets, we offer the following suggestions:
1. The PolitiFact and GossipCop datasets were sourced using the FakeNewsNet tool, as described in the research by 
Kai Shu, Deepak Mahudeswaran, Suhang Wang, Dongwon Lee, and Huan Liu in their 2020 paper titled "Fakenewsnet: A Data Repository with News Content, Social Context, and Spatiotemporal Information for Studying Fake News on Social Media," published in Big Data, Volume 8, Issue 3, pages 171â€“188.
2. To validate the efficacy of our method, we have also utilized the LIAR dataset, which is accessible here https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/data/liar_dataset.zip. Additionally, we employed the Fakeddit dataset, available on https://github.com/entitize/Fakeddit.
